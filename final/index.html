       <h1>Pitch for The Final</h1>
       <h1>What's Your Spiritual Animal?</h1>
       <h2>Cammy Wan - MMP310</h2>
       <p>My final project would be very similar to <a href="http://api.emilyhashemi.com/">Pet Finder</a> </p>
       <p>It would take you to go through three questions, and then it will generate your spiritual animal. The questions should be similiar to:</p>
       <p>Which month were you born? </p>
       <p>Are you male or female?</p>
       <p>Choose one of the five colors below that you like the most.</p>
