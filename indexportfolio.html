         <h4>About Me</h4>  
        <p>My name is Qing, but I usually go by Cammy, a girl born and raised in Wuhan, China and moved to the city in July of 2016. My major is MMP, and this is my third semester. My goal is to become a web designer or UI/UX designer, and dream job would be to be come a freelancing designer while traveling through the world. <br><br> Traveling is my passion. I spent 6 months traveling through the States and then another 6 months backpacking in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia.Even for now that I live in the city, I still do short trips to DC, Philly etc. </p>
